# Measurement System Analysis

## General

* MSA / Gauge R&R conformal measurement system analysis. 
* It will compute statistical values based of repetitive measurements to generate values describing the system quality in means of repeatability and reliability.
* The generated data can be output via an excel sheet.
* Please see the sparse documentation here: [README.pdf](doc/README.pdf)

## Add-on development

* The add-on is meant to be as an example for your own project.
