# Text detection in images

This example demonstrates how external libraries can be used to detect and extract text fragments in images. It uses the Tesseract library for that purpose.

## Preliminaries

The following python wheels must be added to the add-on and are not included due to copyright reasons:

* numpy
* opencv_python
* tesseract

In addition, the tesseract executable must be installed and the path to the executable must be added to the scripts.
