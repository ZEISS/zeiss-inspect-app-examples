# DisplayImage

This example demonstrates how to read a measurement image from a project and display it in PNG format using an image widget in a user defined script dialog.

## Example

## Preliminaries

* For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the measurement list from which the image is read has a fixed name ('Scan 1').
* You have to install [OpenCV python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) for the example to run.
* The example code is part of an App, so OpenCV Python wheel must be added to this App's environment.
