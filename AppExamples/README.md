| Category | App | Description |
| -------- | --- | ----------- |
| data_interfaces | CheckResultsDataArray | This example demonstrates two ways of accessing result data from checks using the element properties and data interfaces. |
| data_interfaces | ReferencePointsAndMeshData | This example demonstrates how to access the reference points in a measurement and the mesh from Python. |
| data_interfaces | VolumeSectionImageData | This example demonstrates how to access the image data of a volume section. |
| dialog_widgets | DropdownWidget | This basic example shows how to use the dropdown widget and how to define items at script runtime. |
| dialog_widgets | ExplorerSelectedElementsInDialog | This example shows how to get a list of elements selected in the element explorer and use it in a script dialog.  |
| dialog_widgets | UnitDialogEventHandler | This basic example demonstrates how to use an event handler on a script dialog to set the unit to multiple widgets. |
| dialog_widgets | WidgetVisibility | This example shows how to use a dialog event handler to turn on/off widget visibilities. |
| misc | CSVExample | This example demonstrates how to read and write CSV files (comma separated values) from an App. |
| misc | DialogReopenExample | This examples demonstrates, how a dialog can be closed from its own handler, just to be opened again. |
| misc | PointPixelTransformations | This example demonstrates how to find the 2D pixel coordinates of a 3D point coordinate and vice versa. |
| projects | ExampleProjects | ZEISS INSPECT Example Projects |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualCircle | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘circle’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualCone | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘cone’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualCurve | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘curve’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualCylinder | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘cylinder’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualDistance | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘distance’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualPoint | These are two examples for scripted actual points, which serve as an introduction to the concept of scripted actual elements. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualPointCloud | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘point cloud’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualSection | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘section’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualSurface | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘surface’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualSurfaceCurve | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘surface curve’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualVolume | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘volume’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualVolumeDefects | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘volume defects’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualVolumeRegion | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘volume region’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedActualVolumeSection | This is an example for a scripted actual ‘volume section’ element. |
| scripted_actuals | ScriptedElementProgress | This examples demonstrates how to show progress information to the user while calcualting a scripted element. |
| scripted_actuals | TrimeshDeformMesh | This example demonstrates how to generate a custom surface element using a scripted element. The example script accesses mesh information from an existing mesh in the project and adds a random deformation to each point. |
| scripted_checks | ScriptedCurveCheck | This example demonstrates how to create a scalar curve check by a script. Also, the usage of custom coordinate systems in scripted checks is shown. |
| scripted_checks | ScriptedScalarCheck | This example shows how to create a scalar check by script. A scalar check is the most basic check, as it assigns a scalar value to an element. Nearly all elements you can find in the software can be checked like this. |
| scripted_checks | ScriptedSurfaceCheck | This example demonstrates how to create a scalar surface check by a script. Also, the usage of custom coordinate systems and element preview in scripted checks is shown. |
| script_icons | ScriptIcon | This example shows how an icon can be set to a script, whereas the icon itself resides in the App as a resource. |
| script_resources | ScriptResources | A simple example showing the usage of script resources. |
