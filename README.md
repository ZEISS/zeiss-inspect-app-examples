# ZEISS INSPECT App Examples

This repository contains various [ZEISS INSPECT](https://www.zeiss.com/metrology/products/software.html#inspectionsolutions) App examples for educational and inspirational purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> Please have a look into the [ZEISS INSPECT App Development Documentation](https://zeissiqs.github.io/) for a general introduction to ZEISS INSPECT App development and the API specification.

In principle, a ZEISS INSPECT App is just a zip'ped directory with a special structure, containing scripts, templates, definitions etc. necessary to add features to the ZEISS INSPECT software. The Apps listed here can be downloaded in compressed form via the [ZEISS Quality Software Store](https://software-store.zeiss.com). Alternatively, for fiddling around with them, the App repository can be cloned, zip'ed and then dropped right into ZEISS INSPECT. Please see the documentation mentioned above for more details or consult the [ZEISS Quality Training Center](https://training.gom.com) for a general feature overview.
