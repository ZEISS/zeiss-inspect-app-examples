# AddOnExamples

This repository contains various ZEISS Inspect add-on examples for educational and inspirational purposes.

Please have a look into the [ZEISS Inspect add-on documentation](https://zeissiqs.github.io/) for a general introduction and the API specification.

In principle, a ZEISS Inspect add-on is just a zip'ed directory with a special structure, containing script, templates, definitions etc. necessary to add features to the ZEISS Inspect software. The add-ons listed here can be downloaded in compressed form via the ZEISS Quality Software Store in the [ZEISS Quality Suite](https://www.gom.com/en/products/zeiss-quality-suite). Alternatively, for fiddling around with them, the add-ons repository can, too, be cloned, zip'ed and then dropped right into ZEISS Inspect. Please see the documentation mentioned above for more details or consult [the training center](https://training.gom.com) for a general feature overview.
